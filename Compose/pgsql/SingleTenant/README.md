# PgSql SingleTenant Configuration Example
This configuration shows a basic example of a single tenant configuration where a single ODS database serves all data going through the API. While this example has one ODS for demonstration purposes, single tenant deployments can support separate ODS databases per school year and district.

Includes the following web applications:
* Ed-Fi Web API
* Ed-FI ODS Admin Api

See [Ed-Fi Docker Compose Architecture](https://docs.ed-fi.org/reference/docker/ed-fi-docker-compose-architecture) for more information.
